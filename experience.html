          <!-- Pines Landscaping — Crew Foreman -->

            <h3>Pines Landscaping — Crew Foreman</h3>
            <div class="meta">Clarksburg, ON • Apr–Aug 2024; May–Aug 2025</div>
            <div class="body">
              <p>As Crew Foreman, I led 2–8 person teams and coordinated sub‑contractors on
              residential and commercial jobs ranging from CAD $25k to $500k and lasting two weeks to three months.
              I owned day‑to‑day planning, set clear expectations at the start of shift, and kept the site moving by
              aligning materials, equipment, and crews against the plan. I was the primary on‑site contact for clients
              and project managers, resolving issues quickly and keeping stakeholders in the loop with plain‑English
              status updates.</p>
              <p>I trained new hires on machine operation, tool safety, and site procedures, building a culture of
              accountability and good housekeeping. Where possible I standardized checklists, made simple trackers for
              hours and deliveries, and tightened hand‑offs between trades—small changes that reduced rework and kept
              schedules predictable.</p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Scope &amp; coordination:</strong> scheduled subs, verified deliveries, sequenced work to minimize downtime.</li>
                <li><strong>Client interface:</strong> single point of contact on site; clarified scope, change orders, and acceptance criteria.</li>
                <li><strong>Safety &amp; training:</strong> onboarded new operators and reinforced safe operating procedures.</li>
              </ul>
