      <h2>Who Am I.</h2>
      <p>I’m Connor Button, a Queen’s Applied Economics student and Business Certificate candidate. My skillsets are the combination of hands-on leadership and analytical problem-solving. From leading construction projects as a foreman to excelling in the top percentiles of my economics courses, I’ve learned how to manage complex projects with both precision and adaptability.</p>
      <p>I love travel, the outdoors, and challenging myself with tough projects. Recently, that challenge has been teaching myself to code and design in my free time using AI tools. The outcome, I have built this website entirely from scratch without the assistance of pre-made platforms. It’s been a process of problem-solving and learning by doing, which has rewarded me with new skills and a pretty great website.</p>
      <p>I am driven, hard-working, capable, and passionate. This allows me to visualize my path and take the steps needed to execute my future.</p>
